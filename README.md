# Fraud-Transaction-Detection

## Project Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, we can build models to identify potentially fraudulent activities and help in preventing fraud in financial systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is located in the `data/` directory. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the dataset, and handle it in compliance with any applicable privacy and data protection regulations.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
    - `fraud_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook for the project.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
    - `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for preprocessing the transaction data.
    - `model_training.py`: Script for training the machine learning models.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
